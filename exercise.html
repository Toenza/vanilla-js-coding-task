<h1>My chess picture gallery</h1>
<p>
    Exercise: As a big chess fan, you would like to create a library of chess pictures.<br>
    For this, you want to be using unsplash to get random chess pictures
    (<a href="https://unsplash.com/documentation#get-a-random-photo">unsplash documentation</a>).<br>
    You want to be able to pick one of those images and drop it in a box to choose which is your favorite picture.<br>
    Requirements:
<ul>
    <li>Display 20 random chess images</li>
    <li>Have the images be displayed in a gallery layout with columns</li>
    <li>The images should all be of the same width, but keep their original height/width ratio</li>
    <li>The images should be evenly spaced on each column</li>
    <li>You should be able to drag-and-drop any of the gallery images into a "favourite image" box</li>
    <li>The images in the gallery should be highlighted in some way (e.g. border) when they are hovered over</li>
</ul>
You are allowed to use any source of information you would like (w3schools.com etc).<br>
Try using ES6+ features as much as possible.
Try using flexbox css properties as much as possible
