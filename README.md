Exercise: As a big chess fan, you would like to create a library of chess pictures.
For this, you want to be using unsplash to get random chess pictures (unsplash documentation).
You want to be able to pick one of those images and drop it in a box to choose which is your favorite picture.
Requirements:

- Display 20 random chess images
- Have the images be displayed in a gallery layout with columns
- The images should all be of the same width, but keep their original height/width ratio
- The images should be evenly spaced on each column
- You should be able to drag-and-drop any of the gallery images intoa "favourite image" box
- The images in the gallery should be highlighted in some way (e.g. border) when they are hovered over

You are allowed to use any source of information you would like (w3schools.com etc).
Try using ES6+ features as much as possible. Try using flexbox css properties as much as possible
